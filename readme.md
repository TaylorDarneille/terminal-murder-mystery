There's been a murder in Terminal City, and TCPD needs your help.

To figure out whodunit, go to the 'mystery' subdirectory and start working from there.

You'll want to start by collecting all the clues at the crime scene (the 'crimescene' file).

The officers on the scene are pretty meticulous, so they've written down EVERYTHING in their officer reports.

Fortunately the sergeant went through and marked the real clues with the word "CLUE" in all caps.

Don't use a text editor to view any files except these instructions and hints(or use the cat command to read these in a separate terminal window).
